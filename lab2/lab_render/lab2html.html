                <h1>Usability</h1>
                <h2> 1. According to tools.pingdom.com, the home page is 72.5%. <br> The first thing I would change use less pictures <br>
                in order to make it load faster</h2>
                <h2>2. It is quite the responsive website, for it has two slideshows going on. <br> 
                I would get rid of the biggest slideshow and keep the one that is labeled 'The Latest News from our blog'</h2>
                <h1>Accesibility</h1>
                <h2>1. According to WAVE, the Brooklyn Zoo homepage has 4 empty links. That is the first thing I would change</h2>
                <h2>2. Additionally, WAVE states that the homepage has a low contrast color combination <br>
                instead of having green with blue and yellow, I would swap out the yellow with red color. </h2>
